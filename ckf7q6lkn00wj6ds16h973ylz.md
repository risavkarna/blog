Our hope is that this time around, there is a better solution than sacrificing numerous human lives to make a phallic symbol of death-threat.

Yet we like to talk of every large scale project solving a problem X and requiring our top intellectual minds as a 'Manhattan project for X'. It would be our collective failure as a civilization if the top minds we have even after more than half a century still are not any wiser than those in that original Manhattan project.
