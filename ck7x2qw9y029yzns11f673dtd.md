## Time II

# The ABCs and 123s of Time

Time is also in an existential crisis. In  [the previous post](https://risav.dev/time-i-ck7s7kc7300kkzns159cjt4mx)  in this series, we have touched upon the semantic crisis of time and the possibility that time may not exist as a feature of the universe as it is but rather a feature of our modes of understanding of the universe. In this second part of the series, we will focus on three ways of understanding time and how these can be represented in mathematics or physics terms. Hopefully this will build up the toolkit we require to easily dissect the more complex philosophical and technical arguments I would like to present in the third and fourth part of this series. 

These three conceptions of time are also highly problematic. McTaggart’s A series, B series and C series of time each have ugly self-contradictions, infinite regressions and outdated philosophical arguments. Furthermore, even mathematics and physics representing the various aspects of these 3 different possible universes do not claim to define time but rather just measure, calculate or represent these conceptions of time. We will be using  [Euclidean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_space) ,  [Minkowski](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minkowski_space)  and  [Hilbert spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_space)  where time may even become an imaginary number via  [Wick rotation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wick_rotation),  whenever it makes it easier to  [‘shut up and calculate’](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpretations_of_quantum_mechanics#shutup) . We will also have a look at some more definitions of time and imaginary time from various scholars in the field and see if they too are fundamentally noumenal or mere abstractions for aiding calculations and without a physical meaning.

## Heraclitus & Parmenides

The pioneering process philosopher Heraclitus of Ephesus was also prolific in his scientific and logical research. He was a cosmologist, empiricist and a dialetheist logician. For dialetheists, there are propositions that can be both true and false in their logical system, which is recently finding support in modern paraconsistent logics. He also believed in an ever present flux and change. This concept also happened to lend a cool name to my first computer science research group and its online education forum at my university: ‘*Panta Rhei*’ which means ‘everything flows’. For Heraclitus it was not just enough to say that everything is always flowing. He would also insist that everything is always ultimately ‘fire’. This fire too is always in a flux because everything is either fueling the eternal monistic fire or being burned down to ashes by it. Eastern scholars, including Krishna from the epic Mahabharat, also had similar sayings about a single monistic energy or spirit always changing its form, dividing itself infinitely into many forms yet remaining complete, infinite and undying. 

> (This infinite eternal fire would be an interesting topic for a later blog post, when it becomes relevant for our discussions of infinite streams in programming and infinity's types in [the Mathematics' (An)architecture series](https://risav.dev/mathematics-anarchitecture-and-processes-ck5nahog004z4qps1w98ldfz0) or for the upcoming theoretical quantum computer science topics.)

So energy flows and everything flows, all the time. Just like a river always flows downstream. Then, does time itself flow as well? Heraclitus found it impossible to step in the same river twice as the river was always becoming anew. This is similar to how we perceive that a time once passed can never be stepped back in again since current time always seems to be becoming a later time. Two millennia later Nietzsche built upon this and went so far as to say that fixed subjects and entities are not at all possible due to everything’s eternal state of becoming. Becoming in itself is the very process of change in time and space. Perhaps time does flow or have its own eternal state of becoming as well since everything in the world does. 

Perhaps not. Perhaps time is not a part of ‘everything in the world’ in the first place. 

The pioneering metaphysicist Parmenides of Elea, around the same time as Heraclitus, provided one of the first sustained arguments i.e. via a set of premises, deductions and inductions regarding the lack of flux or change in all of reality and regarding the impossibility of actual change, among other things. He argued that whatever is, is. And whatever is not, cannot be. This was an early attempt at defining being philosophically. Furthermore, nothing can come out of nothing, or to be fancy by using Latin - ‘ex nihilo nihil fit’, in a logical world or at least according the sustained arguments under the primitive Parmenidean logical calculus. For something to seemingly change, it already has to be that which will seem to us to have changed. But it is in the very nature of it to not really change from what it essentially is, while still making the appearance of change.

## The Being and The Becoming of Time

Could it be that both Heraclitus and Parmenides are correct? 

In my previous post ‘*A Recipe for making a Developer*’, I had argued that Neil Postman’s thesis in ‘*Amusing Ourselves to Death*’ that Orwellian 1984 never came into being but Huxleyan Brave New World did was in fact not entirely correct. 1984 is more about a politics-borne dystopia and Brave New World is about a social dystopia. I had made a digression, much like this one, to outline how elements of both dystopias can and do co-exist in our societies. In a similar fashion, I would argue that both Heraclitean ‘panta rhei’ and Parmenidean ‘ex nihilo nihil fit’ are arguments, sustained or otherwise, for two different albeit interlinked contexts. Having them together is not paradoxical. I would argue that there is no dichotomy of choice here but I must also stress that this is not a popularly accepted argument in academic philosophy.

Heraclitus is concerned with becoming. Parmenides is concerned with being.

With this basic reading of Heraclitus and Parmenides, we are probably equipped to appreciate the modern continuations of their seemingly contradictory arguments. As some of you familiar with the previously mentioned works of McTaggart might have guessed, Heraclitus’ position leads to the tensed and flow-compliant A series of time whereas Parmenides’ position leads to the non-tensed, indexed and unchanging time in B series. 

As mentioned before, becoming in itself is the process of change in time and space. So does the becoming of time itself require an underlying meta-time? And what about the meta-time itself and how far down do these turtles go? We can escape from infinitely regressive problems like these in A series by using B series. McTaggart believed that there were problems in B series as well, which I doubt, and further that the problems in both A series and B series go away in his less popular C series.


## The A and B Theory of Time

Following the A, B and C series of time of J.M.E McTaggart, Richard Gale coined the terms A-theory and B-theory. Like most others who studied McTaggart, Gale too did not want to entertain the idea of C-series for reasons we will explore later in this essay. Maybe we will find some redemption for the C series after all.

In an A theoretic universe, time flows from past to the present to the future. In a B universe, there is no flow.
The B universe is a multi dimensional block in which the ‘here’ and the ‘now’ are structurally similar. *Anywhere* you are is ‘here’ for you. *Anywhen* you are is ‘now’ for you in the same sense. 'Now' is just where you have reached in time. 'Now' is not flowing into the future with each instant. Just as the spatial coordinates change with your body's movement across space, the time coordinates change with your existence’s unending progression across time. 

> Saying time flows is just as ridiculous as saying space flows. Our existence marches across time, not the other way round. 

In a B Universe, addressing the beginning or the end of an entity or even the universe itself is tricky. Every point of time exists eternally but just becomes inaccessible to some observers by becoming either their past or their future while being ‘the present’ for some other observers. An arbitrary event A in time may occur before a particular event P for some observers while A may occur 

I mention ‘the present’ in quotes because in B theory, there is no present, or past and future for that matter. However the present may not exist at all and this may be true not just in B theoretic universes. Our senses are never experiencing the present since sensation and perception is never instantaneous. We cannot even ascribe a duration to the present other than, if we are being too stubborn about it, an infinitesimal, which like infinity is not even a number. 

In case you are wondering, Planck Time is not a good candidate either for the duration of 'present'. There is no reason to believe that Planck Time, derived from Newton’s universal gravitational constant G, Einstein’s relativistic constant c and Planck constant ħ, has any physical significance  as it merely represents the time required by light to travel one Planck length in an ideal vacuum of space. Consequentially, it describes firstly, an approximate time scale at which quantum gravitational effects might become important and, secondly, the upper bound on the frequency of any wave. Nothing we ever do or experience in our lives or in scientific experiments occurs at the Planck scales. 

The A theory is a common sense theory of time that we find easy to digest. We can compare time to the Heraclitean river. Time does seem to be flowing through past, present and future after all. The B theory however is the more scientifically sound theory of time. Einstein would agree with it since his redefinition of space-time and Minkowski’s Minkowski space is what led to the block universe model espoused by B theory in the first place. We can compare it to the Parmenidean view of unchanging reality or roughly to an ocean which displays tides or currents in some sections but remains unchanged overall. In a famous letter of condolence to the family of his childhood friend Besso, Einstein wrote, 

> “Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me. [...] That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists, the distinction between past, present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion.” 

We should note that although B theory posits that past, present and future are illusory and eternally exist as indexicals, B theory does not imply or constrain us to a deterministic universe where one particular ‘future’ is fixed in the same way that B theory and relativity do not constrain us to a single absolute ‘past’ for every observer anywhere in the universe. We will see that the block model of the universe may not be contained in just 3 dimensions of space and only 1 of time and that there may thus be enough wiggle space for a non-deterministic future. 

Also note how we end up having to use A theory terms like ‘past’ or ‘future’ to describe aspects of B theory. The reverse is also true and thus equally problematic in establishing a primacy or validity of one theory over the other. B Universes would have a hard time reconciling the concept of change and description of processes according to McTaggart. So McTaggart originally rejected both his A series and B series.

At this point, we have reached the A and the B from the title of this post. Before we dive into the C, we should probably first look at the 123. 

## Time on 1, 2, 3 or more axes

We will discuss linear timelines, complex or imaginary time, quaternionic time and time represented using arbitrary number of axes instead of just one. We will evaluate the usefulness of these representations and see what problems they solve or what predictions they can make.

## The C series and Higher Dimensions of Time

In a true Hegelian fashion, McTaggart reached the C series of time via dialectics. A series was the incumbent thesis. B series was the antithesis and C series was supposed to be the synthesis. McTaggart also employed modern metaphysics and analytic philosophy in defense of his neo-Hegelian view in the C series. We will discuss why it is not as popular and what it might inform us of our discussion so far.


*I am trying to compress multiple millennia of thought evolution and multiple semesters of academic work on the philosophy of time in this series so I am probably being hasty, incomplete and maybe incorrect at times. However, I have tried to link to further readings whenever I skip and would love to find corrections, links to resources and feedback, especially for these last two posts in this series.*
