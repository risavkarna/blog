## Time - III [Draft]

# The Crisis in Infinite Quantum Futures

Time is also in a quantum crisis. In the [previous post](https://risav.dev/time-ii-ck7x2qw9y029yzns11f673dtd) in this series, we have touched upon the symbolic and enumerative 'crisis' of time and the possibility that time may not exist as a feature of the symbolic and syntactic universe as it is but rather a feature of our modes of understanding of the symbolic universe. In this third part of the series, we will focus on two ways of understanding time and how these can be represented in mathematics or physics terms. Hopefully, this will build up the toolkit we require to easily dissect the more complex philosophical and technical arguments I would like to present in the third and fourth part of this series. 

These two conceptions of time are also highly problematic. The classical deterministic view and the quantum probabilistic together have ugly mutual contradictions, transfinite regressions, and outdated metaphysical arguments. Furthermore, even mathematics and physics representing the various aspects of these 2 different possible universes do not claim to define time but rather just measure, calculate, or represent these conceptions of time. We will be visiting Non-Euclidean spaces and nullary spaces where time may even become a point or a line as opposed to an imaginary number or a real number in the previous post. I am getting ahead of myself here so we will start at the beginning of the philosophy of science's being and becoming in the west and then jump at least 2 millennia to find the oriental Vedic sciences again.

## Quantum Physics and Quantum Field Theories

> (This also assumes some sort of conservation, especially conservation of mass-energy for physical entities. This would be more fodder for this post on infinitude.)

## Vedic Mathematics and Astrophysics

> (This infinite eternal fire would be an interesting topic for this post when it becomes relevant for our discussions of infinite streams in programming and infinity's types in [the Mathematics' (An)architecture series](https://risav.dev/mathematics-anarchitecture-and-processes-ck5nahog004z4qps1w98ldfz0) or for the upcoming theoretical quantum computer science topics.)

## The Being and The Becoming

> I would argue that both Heraclitean ‘Panta Rhei’ and Parmenidean ‘ex nihilo nihil fit’ are arguments, sustained or otherwise, for two very different albeit interlinked contexts.

## Categorical Dual Theories of Time

> Saying time flows is just as ridiculous as saying space flows. Our existence marches across time, not the other way round. 

> “Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me. [...] That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists, the distinction between past, present, and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion.”
