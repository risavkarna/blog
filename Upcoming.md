Metrics: As a business leader you need to figure out the metric that matters most for your company and understand that the more you measure, the less prioritized you’ll be. Don’t fall into the trap of trying to measure everything. What I’ve learned is that in the early days, what matters most is having customers who love and use your product. Figure out the one or two best measures to determine this.

Actionable, Accessible, Auditable metrics

Since the value of a platform is derived primarily from network effects, platform metrics should ultimately seek to measure the rate of interaction success and the factors that contribute to it. Interaction success attracts active users and thereby enhances the development of positive network effects.
concentrate on metrics that track the strength of characteristics that enable core interactions on the platform, including liquidity, matching, and trust.
the most important metric is a simple one: the number of happy customers on every side of the network who are repeatedly and increasingly engaged in positive, value-creating interactions.

There's people worried that it might also cause neurological damage that were not even close to understanding.

Our early beliefs that this was just a spicy flu were totally wrong. It's a spicy flu in *some* people and something much much worse and much more confusing in others. That's a big part of why the goal shifted to extended lockdowns. It wasn't just about lowering the curve so hospitals could prep anymore, its because we need as much time to study this weirdo as possible and every additional day does make a tangible difference

## Review and Excerpts from The Unthinkable by Hasan A Rahman

A 2007 study by Wood and Neal found that when behaviors are repeated in a consistent context, there is an incremental increase in the link between the context and the action.

information-action ratio

television is altering the meaning of ‘being informed' by creating a species of information that might properly be called disinformation -- misplaced, irrelevant, fragmented or superficial information that creates the illusion of knowing something but which in fact leads one away from knowing

decontextualized information “made the relationship between information and action both abstract and remote.'' Information consumers were “faced with the problem of a diminished social and political potency.'' 

If information doesn’t lead to a (useful) action, it would eventually “habituate” us of, or have us get used to seeing information as unrelated to action and, more importantly, hinder our ability to understand usefulness. 

Naturally, that would lead to a diminished will, amenable to control by external influences. 

Value certainly can be synthesized. It can be created within individual perceptions as well as social perceptions. Groups, organizations and nations can agree on the value of something. Though what we mostly see in the world is one group “setting up'' the value of something and the other, considerably larger, albeit “weaker'' group being explicitly or implicitly, externally or internally, forced to accept that value system. 

Moreover, we cannot differ with regard to something, perhaps the only thing, that we know is definitely going to happen in the future, without the shadow of a doubt: we're all going to die.

So some objective realities can exist, an exhaustive list of which can probably be put together. If one knows that one has limited time left, time becomes one of the most (objectively) valuable assets that one has.

The way we live is as if death is not imminent - directly enforcing our views on an objective reality.

Individuals or actors have social lives, governed lives and economic lives. The three systems interact with each other via the actors, whose choices influence and are influenced by these systems, as well as via their very definitions.

“According to many historians, the concept religion was first used in Europe in the 1500s as a way to distinguish between the domain of church authority and that of civil authorities. Thus the term religion assumes that there are aspects of life that are not involved in religion. Actually, however, this compartmentalization of religion is not found in all societies today, and was not found anywhere before 1500. Many languages do not even have a word equivalent to our word “religion'', nor is such a word found in either the Bible or the Qur'an. Religion was contrasted with politics by kings and emperors who wanted to command some of the loyalty and service that people devoted to bishops and the Pope. To build nation-states, for example, kings and emperors wanted a monopoly on the legitimate use of force or violence, and that required that church leaders give up their authority to create armies, as they had done in the Crusades. Eventually, kings and emperors demanded complete control over things involved in “this world'' -- the secular world (from the Latin saeculum, referring to things that exist in ordinary time). They wanted to create and enforce laws, collect taxes, and regulate trade, in addition to waging wars. They therefore wanted church officials to limit their activities to those things dealing with the “other'' world -- the eternal world. They wanted them to stay out of power politics and limit themselves to things like interpreting scripture, formulating doctrines, and conducting rituals. These would come to be characterized as “holy'' or “sacred'' and, for Christians, they became the proper sphere of religion.'' - 50 Great Myths of Religion

Kelly Baker at Religion Bulletin says: “...belief is a problematic starting point for the study of religious people. It is an impoverished concept that ignores how people embody, enact, imagine, practice, participate, discuss, envision, hope, desire, want, and construct their religions. Religion is not simply belief, but is enmeshed in lives, materially and metaphysically.

We're a very practical species, we believe things in order to do things and doing things reinforces our beliefs.

Fishbein, Martin, and Icek Ajzen in their work Belief, Attitude, Intention and Behavior, and they show that “Behavioral intention is the main motivator of behavior, while the two key determinants on behavioral intention are people's attitudes and norms''. 


In addition to simply describing reality using abstractions such as for natural systems, in recent years we have actually been using “software'', explicit sets of instructions that guide and dictate computation. The importance or role of the intangible, of abstractions, could not be more clear than it is to a computer scientist. Software itself seems to lie on the boundary of the purely physical and the purely psychological, and thus makes it easy to see rather clearly the underlying psychological, ideological or abstract - objects, for the lack of a better term - that constitute it. Consider the following: “Why is it that some software engineers and computer scientists are able to produce clear, elegant designs and programs, while others cannot? Is it purely a matter of intelligence? Is it possible to improve the skills and abilities of those less able through further education and training? .... a sound understanding of abstraction, the ability to perform abstract thinking and to exhibit abstraction skills, is crucial for computing professionals.”


Protons and neutrons, made up of quarks, and electrons orbiting around them, you say. What in the devil are those? I ask, and then you just shrug... What can you say? Maths? Abstractions? Ideas? Things intangible or immaterial? Are you sure?, I ask. You're using abstractions and purely theoretical constructs to describe nature. You're claiming that the ontological status of the most basic constituents of the material universe is something purely immaterial...

“Why is it that some software engineers and computer scientists are able to produce clear, elegant designs and programs, while others cannot? Is it purely a matter of intelligence? Is it possible to improve the skills and abilities of those less able through further education and training? .... a sound understanding of abstraction, the ability to perform abstract thinking and to exhibit abstraction skills, is crucial for computing professionals.”

Touching thus is nothing but immaterial forces interacting and the brain perceiving the interaction as a feeling - as a material object's feel. Your brain doesn't tell you the nature of the force itself - that bit of information is regarded as completely unnecessary, perhaps even impossible to attain, but completely useless nonetheless. It tells you what the force is like - more specifically, it characterizes the force, tells us its properties i.e. it gives a qualitative description. It answers the ontological question, rather than the ontic.


The least we can say, upon considering all of the above, is that the tangible and intangible both are not just real and exist side by side, but are integral to each other's existence - together they form a unified whole. Not unsurprisingly, we usually don't think that way. Apparently a “systems'' thinking is not what we seem to prefer.
